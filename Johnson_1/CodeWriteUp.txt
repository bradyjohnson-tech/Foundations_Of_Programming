Project_1 pseudocode:

1. Prompt for the radius of the circle (input will be a float)

2. Call function to calculate circumference
3. Call function to calculate the area
4. Call function to calculate the volume
5. Call function to output the equations used

Notes:
Will use floats throughout the program rounding to five significant digits after the decimal.
Will only use one class meaning functions will have to be defined before I can call them in the project. All calls will be at the bottom of the file
